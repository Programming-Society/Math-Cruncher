# Math-Cruncher
Solve 8 math problems in rapid succession and as quickly as possible. Scores are the cumulative amount of time it takes to solve all 8 problems. The person with the lowest score wins.

This program will be developed in concert during the 10/15/2021 TPS educational meeting. We will use GitHub and Visual Studio's Live Share to facilitate the rapid creation of this math game. The exercise will focus on using the features built into GitHub. 

--Various design thoughts--
Classes are not implemented to make the focus of this project on the collaboration tools and building teamwork. 

Scores and usernames are kept in two shared files.

Someone could implement a mongloid db instead of this rough file system. The implementation was left up to the programmers of those functions.

Programmers can implement additional methods as the need arises.
